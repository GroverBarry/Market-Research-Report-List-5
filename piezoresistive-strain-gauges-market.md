<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Piezoresistive Strain Gauges Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Foil Strain Gage</li><li>Wire Strain Gage</li><li>Semiconductor Strain Gage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Piezoresistive strain gauges are sensors that are used to measure strain or deformation in an object by utilizing the piezoresistive effect. There are three main types of piezoresistive strain gauges: foil strain gage, wire strain gage, and semiconductor strain gage. Foil strain gages are made by attaching a thin strip of metal foil to a flexible substrate, while wire strain gages use a fine wire that is attached to the surface of the object. Semiconductor strain gages use semiconducting materials to measure strain in the object.</p></p>
