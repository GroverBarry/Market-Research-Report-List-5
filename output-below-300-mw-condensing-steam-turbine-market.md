<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Output Below 300 MW Condensing Steam Turbine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Recombustion</li><li>Non-recombustion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The output below 300 MW condensing steam turbine market consists of two main types: recombustion and non-recombustion. Recombustion turbines utilize additional burners to reheat the steam before it is condensed, increasing efficiency. On the other hand, non-recombustion turbines do not have this additional stage of combustion and rely solely on the initial heat from the steam to generate power. Both types have their own advantages and limitations, catering to different applications and requirements in the power generation sector.</p></p>
