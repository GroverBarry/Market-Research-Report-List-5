<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillators (CRT-Ds)</li><li>Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Pacemakers (CRT-Ps)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) Systems are devices used to treat heart failure by coordinating the contractions of the heart's ventricles. There are two main types of CRT systems - Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillators (CRT-Ds) and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Pacemakers (CRT-Ps). CRT-Ds not only provide resynchronization therapy but also have defibrillation capabilities to treat life-threatening arrhythmias. CRT-Ps deliver resynchronization therapy through pacing the heart's chambers. Both types of devices aim to improve heart function and overall quality of life for patients with heart failure.</p></p>
