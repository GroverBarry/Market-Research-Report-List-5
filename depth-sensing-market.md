<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Depth Sensing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stereo Vision</li><li>Structured Light</li><li>Time-of-flight</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Depth sensing technology is used in various industries, such as robotics, automotive, and healthcare. The three main types of depth sensing technologies are stereo vision, structured light, and time-of-flight. Stereo vision uses two cameras to create a depth map by comparing the disparities between the two images. Structured light projects a pattern onto an object and measures distortions to determine depth. Time-of-flight calculates depth by measuring the time it takes for light to travel from the sensor to the object and back.</p></p>
