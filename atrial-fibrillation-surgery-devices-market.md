<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atrial Fibrillation Surgery Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Catheter Ablation</li><li>Maze Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Atrial Fibrillation Surgery Devices Market includes catheter ablation and Maze surgery. Catheter ablation involves inserting a thin tube (catheter) into the heart to destroy small areas of heart tissue that are causing abnormal heart rhythms. Maze surgery is a more invasive procedure that creates a pattern of scar tissue in the heart to disrupt abnormal electrical signals. Both procedures aim to restore normal heart rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation, improving their quality of life and reducing the risk of complications.</p></p>
