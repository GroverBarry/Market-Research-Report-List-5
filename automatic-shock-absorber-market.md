<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Shock Absorber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Overflow Hole Shock Absorber</li><li>Annular Hole Shock Absorber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automatic shock absorbers come in two main types: Overflow Hole Shock Absorbers and Annular Hole Shock Absorbers. Overflow Hole Shock Absorbers have small holes that allow excess oil to flow out, preventing the suspension from becoming too stiff. Annular Hole Shock Absorbers, on the other hand, have a ring-shaped hole that controls the flow of oil, providing a smoother and more controlled ride. Both types offer different ways of managing the damping force in the suspension system for optimal performance and comfort.</p></p>
