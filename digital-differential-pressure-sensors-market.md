<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Differential Pressure Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Silicon Based</li><li>Foil Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Digital differential pressure sensors are categorized into two main types: silicon-based and foil-based. Silicon-based sensors utilize a silicon diaphragm that deflects under pressure, leading to a change in capacitance that is measured and converted into a digital output. On the other hand, foil-based sensors use a thin metal foil diaphragm that deforms under pressure, causing a change in resistance that is then converted into a digital signal. Both types of sensors offer accurate and reliable measurement of pressure differentials in various applications.</p></p>
