<p><strong>The Railway Track Axle Counter Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ballast Track</li><li>Ballastless Track</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Railway Track Axle Counters are used in both ballast tracks and ballastless tracks to accurately count the number of axles passing over a specific section of the track. In ballast tracks, the axle counter helps in monitoring train movements through the gravel or rock-filled track bed. In ballastless tracks, the axle counter is essential for tracking trains on concrete or steel tracks without traditional ballast support. This technology is crucial for ensuring safe and efficient railway operations in both types of track systems.</p></p>
