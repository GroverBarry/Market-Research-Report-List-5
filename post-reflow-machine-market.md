<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Post-Reflow Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Convection Ovens</li><li>Vapour Phase Oven</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Post-Reflow Machine market types include Convection Ovens and Vapour Phase Ovens. Convection Ovens use heated air to evenly distribute heat throughout the chamber, making them ideal for high-volume production. Vapour Phase Ovens use a vapour phase liquid to transfer heat, providing better thermal efficiency and eliminating overheating risks. Both types offer precise temperature control and uniform heating, but Vapour Phase Ovens are preferred for sensitive components due to their gentle heating process.</p></p>
