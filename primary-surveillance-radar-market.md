<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Primary Surveillance Radar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>S-Band</li><li>L-Band</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) operates in two main frequency bands - S-Band and L-Band. S-Band radar systems typically operate in the 2-4 GHz frequency range and offer higher resolution and accuracy for tracking aircraft. They are commonly used in long-range air traffic surveillance systems. On the other hand, L-Band radar operates in the 1-2 GHz frequency range and is known for its ability to penetrate adverse weather conditions and offer better coverage at lower altitudes. Both S-Band and L-Band radar systems play a crucial role in air traffic control and surveillance operations.</p></p>
