<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Walk-through Metal Detection Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>LC Oscillating Metal Detector</li><li>Pulse Induction (PI) Metal Detector</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Walk-through metal detection systems come in two main types:</p><p>1. LC Oscillating Metal Detector:</p><p>This type of metal detector operates using a coil of wire that creates an oscillating magnetic field. When a metal object passes through this field, it disrupts the frequency, triggering an alarm.</p><p>2. Pulse Induction (PI) Metal Detector:</p><p>PI metal detectors work by sending powerful pulses of electricity through a coil of wire. When a metal object is present, it creates an eddy current which is detected by the system, causing an alarm to sound.</p></p>
