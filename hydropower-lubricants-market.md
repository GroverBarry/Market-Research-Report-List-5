<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydropower Lubricants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heavy Duty Hydropower Lubricants</li><li>Light Duty Hydropower Lubricants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydropower lubricants can be categorized into two main types: heavy duty and light duty. Heavy duty hydropower lubricants are designed for use in high-pressure and high-temperature environments, typically in large-scale hydropower systems. These lubricants have a higher viscosity and are more durable to withstand the demanding conditions. On the other hand, light duty hydropower lubricants are used in smaller-scale hydropower systems or for less demanding applications. They have a lower viscosity and are suitable for lower pressure and temperature conditions.</p></p>
