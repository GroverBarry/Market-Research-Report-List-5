<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agriculture Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Agriculture Tires</li><li>Bias (Crossply) Agriculture Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agriculture tires can be classified into two main types: radial agriculture tires and bias (crossply) agriculture tires. Radial tires have reinforced layers running radially from bead to bead, providing better traction and reduced soil compaction. Bias tires have crisscrossing ply layers, offering more sidewall flexibility and better puncture resistance. Radial tires are more commonly used in modern agricultural machinery due to their superior performance, while bias tires are still preferred for certain applications due to their lower cost.</p></p>
