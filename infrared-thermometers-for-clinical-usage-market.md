<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infrared Thermometers for Clinical Usage Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-contact Type</li><li>Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Infrared thermometers for clinical usage come in two main market types: non-contact and contact. Non-contact thermometers are designed to measure temperature from a distance, making them ideal for situations where physical contact is not recommended, such as during a pandemic. Contact thermometers, on the other hand, require direct contact with the patient's skin or body to measure temperature accurately. Both types offer fast and accurate temperature readings, but non-contact thermometers are preferred in certain clinical settings for their convenience and hygiene benefits.</p></p>
